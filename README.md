# Tic Tac Toe in a lot of Languages

I'm refreshing my knowledge on programming languages! I will be creating a simple tic-tac-toe program (mostly command line IO) in a ton of different languages! I'll start with the ones I already know, and who knows maybe I'll branch out :OO

If anyone has a suggestion on new languages I should add, just create a pull request and edit this file :)) - I'll attempt any language, even esoteric ones hehe
